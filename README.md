# Tower of Hanoi
**by Curtis Yungen**

September 2019

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three tower and five discs of different sizes. The puzzle begins with all five discs stacked on the left-most tower. The objective of the game is to move the entire stack to the right-most tower while abiding by three simple rules: 

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
